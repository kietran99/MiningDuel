  - Hello! You must be here for the Quirk tutorial.
  - As the last of the 3 Diggable types, this one is by far the most fascinating!
  - You see, no one ever knows whoever invented Quirks.
  - They are advanced technologies that occasionally appears underground.
  - Fortunately, we can use them to our advantage in game matches.
  - Collected Quirks can be activated by pressing this button, but currently yours
    is vacant.
  - Like other Diggables, you have to dig for this one too.
  - Luckily, I've supplied you with a Quirk, the Mighty Blessing!
  - It grants you the power to excavate all gems in a small area around the player.
  - Here, try it for yourself! Just hit the button real hard.
  - Hehe awesome right! There are also other types of Quirk but you have to discover
    by yourself.
  - So that's all the basics about Quirks! Find you in another tutorials.
