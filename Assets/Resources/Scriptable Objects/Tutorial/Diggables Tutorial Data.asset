  - Welcome to Diggable 101!
  - Where we will cover the basics of Diggables.
  - Do you know that there are 3 types of
  - 'Diggable in this world? Which comprises:'
  - Gems - Rack up as much of these as possible to win the game.
  - Projectiles - Your primary support as well as offensive tools.
  - And last but not least!
  - Quirks - These are amazing as they grant players
  - superior abilities that can turn the tides
  - of the battle if used correctly!
  - But wait. There's a catch! You see, these Diggables
  - are not exposed to the naked eye so you probably
  - can't see any of them (well unless you freakin' cheat and that's not nice at
    all)
  - Fortunately, the mechanics of this world invented a nice little tool
  - which is the circle zone around the player called the Sonar!
  - Every Diggable is visible inside the Sonar
  - hence using the Sonar wisely is the key to victory.
  - That's it for the Diggable introduction.
  - See you in other tutorials.
