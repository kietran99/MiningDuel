  - Welcome to Diggable 101!
  - Where we will cover the basics of Diggables.
  - Do you know that there are 3 types of Diggable in this world?
  - Which comprises Gems, Projectiles and Quirks (which will be
  - later explain in more details in the following tutorials).
  - They appear all over the map where you can freely excavate.
  - That sounds too lame simple, isn't it?
  - But wait, there's a catch!
  - You see, these Diggables are not exposed to the naked eye
  - so you probably can't see any of them.
  - (Unless you freakin' cheat and that's not nice at all!)
  - Fortunately, the mechanics brilliantly invented a nice little tool
  - which is the circle zone around below the character called the Sonar!
  - Every single Diggable is visible inside the Sonar scan zone.
  - Hence using the Sonar wisely is the key to victory!
  - That's it for the Diggable introduction.
  - See you in the next tutorials.
