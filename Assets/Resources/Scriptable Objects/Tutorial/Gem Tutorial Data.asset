  - Welcome to Gem tutorial!
  - Let's start with the basics of Gem.
  - As you may know, Gem is the most precious resource in this world.
  - Therefore your prime goal should be mining as much Gem as possible.
  - The more Gem you collected the higher your final score.
  - So be sure to give it your best shot!
  - Sounds exciting?
  - Now let's try it out, shall we?
  - First of all, let's give it a quick scan to see if any Gems are nearby.
  - Hey! There's a Gem over there! Let's head towards and step on top of it!
  - Now hit the dig button.
  - Nicely done!
  - Now pay attention to this!
  - You just dig up a Common Gem so your score increases by 1.
  - There is a wide array of Gem in this world
  - and rarer ones net you more score but also take longer to dig up!
  - Moreover, the higher your score is the faster it increases,
  - Indicated by the number over here.
  - Amazing, right?
  - However, your current score is only temporary until
  - you all collected gems are deposited into the storage in the middle of the map.
  - Stand next to the storage to try it out!
  - Well that's all the basics about Gems.
  - I'll find you in another tutorial.
