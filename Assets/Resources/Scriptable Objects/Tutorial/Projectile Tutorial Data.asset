  - Welcome to Projectile tutorial!
  - As one of the popular Diggable types in this world,
  - Projectiles play essential roles in supporting players
  - as well as offensive play style.
  - Similar to Gems, Projectiles are hidden, thus they can only be found using the
    Sonar.
  - Let's try to look for one, It should look like a bomb.
  - There it is, come over and dig it up.
  - Great! Now you're holding a Normal Bomb, which is a pretty common type of Projectile.
  - Be aware that Projectiles explode after a short amount of time.
  - So if you keep holding it , you'll damage yourself in a couple of seconds!
  - As you can see as the Projectile has changed colors,
  - which implies that it's about to go boom, so better throw it quickly!
  - It's best to throw Projectiles at another player
  - as they will drop a bunch of gems if they get hit.
  - Hey, conveniently there's a practicing target over there!
  - Let's throw a full-force shot at them.
  - Tap somewhere on the screen to throw at that direction.
